// The abstract class client API, i.e. the API that the chess engine provides to GUI. This API is
// mostly based on UCI interface.
//
// This API mostly assumes that all its methods receive valid parameter values (i.e. the server
// should perform its own validation before calling the client). Though, the client may perform its
// own validation and throw `ApiResult::UnexpectedCall` or `ApiResult::InvalidArgument` in case of
// errors.
//
// Thread-safety note:
// - if you implement a client, then the API calls don't need to be thread safe. They will be called
// by the server in a synchronized manner. In contrast, the server you are connected to must be
// thread safe.
// - if you implement a client connector, then the API calls must be thread safe. This rule also
// applies to option storage (use `SyncOptionStorage` to store the options). The server you are
// connected to is not thread-safe.
